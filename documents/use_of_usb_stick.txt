HOW TO SOLVE USB STICK PROBLEMS:

It is helpful to enable the display of mounted drives on the desktop. Right click on the
desktop, choose Desktop Preferences and click on mounted disks. Now you should see your
USB stick, and you should be able to double click on its symbol.

If you have problems, check the following:

1. How is your USB stick formatted? Out of the box, Raspbian only supports write to FAT32.
If you want to use a stick formatted with EXFAT, install exfat-utils (tested, works with
pi-topOS and Raspbian Stretch):
    sudo apt install exfat-utils
If you want to use a stick formatted with NTFS (not tested by myself, but should work)
   sudo apt install ntfs-3g

2. Is the /media/pi directory screwed up? Go to /media/pi (or another user name if you
are not pi). This directory should be empty, if no USB stick is inserted. If there is
a bad entry there, you can erase it (be very careful, sudo rm -r is an extremely dangerous
command, a typo may make your SD card unusable))
   sudo rm -r /media/pi/name_of_bad_entry
and reboot. name_of_bad_entry would be the name of the bad entry found.
Now insert your stick and do a
  ls -l /media/pi/*
If the stick is properly mounted, you should only see something like
  dwrdwrdwr 1 pi ............... name_of_your_stick
The w's are important, they show that everybody can write to this stick in this case.

3. If you are not user pi, or have changed the permissions of pi, you are on your own.
